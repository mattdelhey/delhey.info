<h2 id="orgheadline1">What does it mean to be an intellectual today?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
First and most clearly: today there is no intellectual. Science has been abandoned in favor of
technological progress (primarily in the advertising industry, which trickle down results being
applied in neuroscience). Natural science, alienated from its historization and dialectical
relations, remains no more than a tool for the progress of the advertising industry (i.e.,"tech
industry"). No doubt it succeeds.
</p>

<p>
Successful cultural production recognizes this reality but can never end here. Kero Kero Bonito's
"Picture this" is an example of what I want to call the reification of reification theory, the real
subsumption of theories of real subsumption. Reification theory: superstructure "determined" and
"founded" upon underlying economic relations and the dominate mode of production. The meta-move
mocks this in the objectification of complaints over objectification:
</p>

<p class="verse">
Hold your camera high and click<br  />
Exercise your right to picture this<br  />
But don't forget to show<br  />
Everybody you've ever known<br  />
When your old and wise you'll find<br  />
All the shots you've got<br  />
Bring back the time it's easy to believe<br  />
Yesterday you're so sweet<br  />
</p>

<p>
Complete resignation to the primacy of economic life; the objectification of this very observation
into the content of cultural production. That is, the very fact of the base mop image maker
dominating superstructure life is made into the <b>content</b> of cultural production.
</p>

<p>
Then what is cultural production? A recognition of the failure of reification theory to bring
economic change; the failure of the negation in light of overwhelming bourgeoisie positivism: "pics are
all I need To show everyone what I've done/ Who I want to be".
</p>

<p>
The music, then, is cultural criticism in the strict sense. Not only that: people listen. Perhaps
this is what it means to be an intellectual today, to satisfy two conditions: (1) daring to speak
the theoretical and (2) people listening, caring, interacting, disagreeing, etc., specifically the
intellectual vanguard. And why not. At this point in the game, thinking as such is entirely void as
a result of new economic constraints, especially on youth, and the resulting stupefaction of all. If
the vanguard's is pop music, then "let it be". (obviously we refer here to the 'mats over the
Beatles&#x2014; who apparently owe their fame to adorno anyway according to internet searchable
conspiracy theory). 
</p>

<p>
It follows that pop music in the "pc music" sense (broadly construed) is the appropriate form of
noise-bound cultural production as we see it today. It is the socially relevant form of objective
spirit, so far as mere muzac is concerned; this is the american successor of rap and hip-hop music
that once dominated such appropriative productions. The new move is the (particularly hegelian)
integration of the <b>recognition</b> of the failure of consciousness of objectification to remove its
hegemonic effects. We might hate Faceoogle, but they still run the game and a bourgeoisie smiling
glace back is a necessary corollary.
</p>

<p>
The content of the intellectual endeavour must be then the very thing that the intellectual despises:
the dominant realization of the means of production, or in the cultural realm, their resulting
relations of production. These relations are the spectacle society as conceived by the '60s (and
likely earlier), however now we understand that their is no alternative, no high-brow culture, no
modernism, no outside, no so-called intellectual perspective on which to judge them a la debord if
only for the sake of our own sanity and continued existence. The only position left for the
intellectual is an immanent theory from within, which (obviously to us, of course) has always been the
case whether its been admitted or not; "always historicize!"
</p>

<p>
This being the case, its clear the traditional "man of letters" simply won't do: this is no longer
the medium for the intellectual expression. One must work in a more entertaining medium, reach a
more experimental audience, and justify themselves on the field of spirit. Impossible without
appropriation of spectacular, technological, economic realities. This is a mere consequence of
valencies in communication, of form; if this spoils content then content is spoiled. Hence the
drug-suicide trends in man-of-letters types, perhaps. Their content, spoiled; what they see in the
world, spoiled; they, spoiled.
</p>

<p>
As we see today, language doesn't give up so easily (despite our best and continued attempts to
delete it). It pokes around on the fringe, i.e. the web blogs the docs to no-where the text messages
and of course the online pdf where all modernism finds its permanent resting place. Paid writers in
the academy even do these things. Language still lives&#x2026; but how? And, more interestingly from the
perspective of an unfunded type more interested in <b>theory</b> than <b>writing</b>, why? Maybe not, it says.
Clearly, a good chunk of this type of thing can be accounted for by the motto "it exists because it
exists": intellectual writing exists because so much labor has gone into its institutionalization,
it is running on pure momentum, low inertia.
