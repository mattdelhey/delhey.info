Party contra daily life

<p>
Club music is an attempt at anti-bourgeoise music in light of the accommodation of seemingly all forms of resistance in the sphere of culture by global capital. Accommodation

<p>
It’s most successful results are always offensive to petty bourgeois taste
</p>



<p>
The theory is as follows: the desire and act of going out in all of its multifarious manifestations is a direct result of the deprived nature of daily life. Because daily life is so unbearable, so unintelligible with respect to its function within a greater whole that is more than (or isn’t just) revenue generation or human rights spreading, because of daily life’s failure to live up to life, we simulate life on a weekly basis at the party. The party is not necessarily an escape from daily life, but rather the concentration of what we take as the shape daily life ought to take. Therefore the escape fails. The party is ground zero for exhaustion and broken dreams as directly shown on the tired faces of its participants. 
</p>

<p>
If we are able to lift daily life out of its miserable condition into something worth being conscious for, the drug anti-weed, then daily life itself
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, for now we must go to the party. Without the party, the dancing, the drugs, the new people, life would remain eclipsed by the its daily falsity. The party is the possibility of a radically new way of living the every day, no matter how banal its particular existence.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
Intellectual historians are unable to produce a successful study of the nineteenth century for a systemic reason: they do everything but historicize.
</p>

<p>
For what appears as the purely ‘ideal’ development of philosophy in the nineteenth century can in fact only be fully and essentially grasped by relating it to the concrete historical development of bourgeois society as a whole. It is precisely this relation that bourgeois historians of philosophy, at their present stage of development, are incapable of studying scrupulously and impartially. 
</p>

<p>
Since the middle of the nineteenth century the whole of bourgeois philosophy, and especially, the bourgeois writing of the history of philosophy, has for socioeconomic reasons abandoned Hegelian philosophy and the dialectical method

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Personalization and the subjectivism of late capitalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
Theorists of mass culture and civil society point to the trend towards universalization in realm of subjective human affairs, both public and private. The concept “mass culture” makes evident the hegemony of the universal. Civil society, man qua market and sphere of circulation, makes little notice of subjective difference so long as you’ve got the cash. Politics of tolerance and equality are the leveling forces. They decree that none shall differ in exchange, politics, law, pornography, society is identical to identity politics, multiculturalism, globalization. 
</p>

<p>
Difference and its so-called celebration and appreciation are the strongest allies of the status quo, as they seek to eradicate difference precisely where it contained its revolutionary potential: in the relations of production, in civil society; they have probably succeeded. 
</p>

<p>
In the wake of the liquidation of all power as such, these politics have limited themselves to discourses making them all the more potent

<h2 id="orgheadline4">On Pornography</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
Amateur pornography is the necessary correlate to the false promise of intimacy in civil society.  The obvious, prima facie overtone of voyeurism in pornography conceals its underlying expression of the desire for meaningful social relations. This is most notable in the actors. Those who choose to film and distribute their fulfillment of the sexual act are not mere exhibitionists; they want to prove their intimacy just as desperately as we the viewers. There is no hope for this unmediated social relation, just as there is no hope for those who wish to step out of the strict rhythm of bourgeois society: you will always upset your mom. The inwardness inherited from the internet target costco harry super potter factory is now, for our historical condition, unavoidable. The dictum is “Be nice or get out” yet we ought to do neither. The reason for seeking out amateur porn is simple: a few drinks, loneliness, a want for a more-than-individual experience. The individualist experience of a desire to no longer be an individual. For making amateur porn, who knows? To show of your kinkiness, to remember and to re-experience, to accommodate the always underrated power autoeroticism? Likely also: the collaboration on taboo thus uniting two against all (forgetting, of course, the one-sidedness of a unity grounded in difference). 
</p>

<p>
Civil society has nearly overcome the problem posed to it by amateur pornography through its sublation in the marriage exchange. Any colloquial conversation regarding (so-called human rights) discourse of marriage equality affirms that marriage is the institution of amateur pornography. 
</p>


<p>
The concept of amateur pornography better explains the social relations predominant of our historical epoch
</p>

<p>
No more and no less than the unity of the Kantian moral right-to-body with bourgeois principle of “happiness” in exchange. Exchange for us simply is the fabrication of sexy video and images

<h2 id="orgheadline5">Star Market</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Star Market was quiet on a Friday afternoon. My walk towards the produce section was interrupted by a loud siren accompanied intermitted by an unintelligible human voice. The siren has no effects and all continues almost more ordinarily than before. I stare down an employee behind the delicatessen whose returning glance signaled confusion but that which was out of place was not the siren but my stare.

<p>
The source of nervousness in conversation is the heat of the closing mold: the real social compulsion to present oneself as “One who enjoys”, that is to say a good and amicable spirit for purchase and labor, for consumption of kitsch (now know as “nice”) and hatred of reason. Nervousness arises from the explicit understanding that all deviations from the norm are deviations from the right (e.g. democracy). No

<p>
The Chinese are the only people who have fully understood the fact that life individuated is completely indeterminate and unworthy of any serious consideration. In full earnest they accept the transparency of human roles, at once refusing to accept anything other than complete annihilation in light of the futility of individuation to establish a singular individual. Rather than worrying about the world historical character of their own life, worry that each text message is a mere exercise in trivial contingency, they embrace the emoji as the signified of meaning approaching the effectivity of other quasi-religions. To “stand out”, they say, is no different than to eat or drink and so they treat it with the same care; they understand that to “stand out” is to do nothing at all, and hence occupy (more heavily relative to their proportion) both extremes of this modality. 
</p>

<p>
The emoji as signified, not signifier… we already know this in daily praxis. Why not give it its theoretical significance, as well? The theoretical significance of daily life if both its reflection and development, so in turn potentially its resistance too. The resistance of life lived without signification or meaning is, as we know, the paradigm of urban life, speckled with drug usage or card games. The resistance melts with the will of the liver and results in office work of which post-fordism leaves no room for disagreement. We have the car, the kid, the lover, the house, the career, the family. Let me call this the big X. What more could we ask for? Would it be anything other than rude for us to ask, dream, speak of more…? More. Who would ever ask for me. Revolutions always ask for less, fewer, perhaps even none at all. Key: difference, not more. And this is why they fail, we might come to think… fail because they do not respect development’s demand for itself manifest in human objectivity. 
</p>

<p>
The big X poses the problem for the dissenter. The big X is the reward for stepping in line with the contemporary bourg. “Where a man’s treasure is, his heart is also” (citation missing)… a man cannot serve two masters, so why not pick the one that gives you the goods? Dissent is attractive to dissenters because of what? Innate hatred of the status quo a la lukacs? Psychoanalytic childhood problems? How did I go so wrong? It’s not a question of going wrong as much as its a question of never having been exposed to the right path. To be alone is a recognition of this fact, always forcing the one alone to reflect on their malpractice in the social sphere.  The big X, uniting us in the common goal for less free time, a life worth lived. 
</p>

<p>
One’s own inability to overcome one’s lack. Oh sure, desire the assemblage, you’re still going to fail to obtain it. That’s why us types are rejection obtaining in general, a mere projection of our childhood inefficacies carried into adult life, spread thing across the working landscape and condensed in our pornography. Imploding into itself into cold nightlife fraught with non-movement, exploding into the activity of the workplace, mediating itself on the road-commute which itself is never spoken, never admitted to ourselves that its the commute that we really live for. The liquid space where our lack is suspended in light of greater concerns: getting somewhere. A motivation that we can always allow ourselves to temporarily reside over desire. We’ll get there, desire, then you can take over again. But until then, I’m in charge… a psychic nothingness that needs not sex, friends, food, as it can always wear the guise of a means. If only such a lie kept itself alive in one’s own free time, or when looking into the eyes of a pretty girl, or when tempted with food or masturbation. Then, it is always missing, and then is when we feel the worse.

The function of loneliness mirrors the function of drink. When new to drinking, one finds in it the social totality. Loneliness, in its own way, asserts the reality of the social totality as well. What’s left for us? 
Writing is just catharsis. Catharsis is just unactualized expectations and social day dreams. Writing just is the social totality, in all its barabism. Words on a bathroom stall.
</p>

<p>
Life folding into itself continuously—the so-called manifold. 
</p>

<p>
Post-contemporary life. My request: speak anything interesting… worth being spoken and heard. When individualism has been raised to its (productively appropriate) place on top of all human unexistence, language, small bits of inexplicable language, linger as residuals of meaning. A humanity founded on the residuals of meaning can only lead to inhumanism. Humans are disgusting, its about time we recognized that. 
</p>

<p>
The fringes of the inter-folded manifold, not explicated according to Kantian metaphysics but recognized only in pathetic lived experience, not in spite of reading but outside of its view, never, of course, outside of its purview. Work, don’t read. Want to read? Hope you’ve read. Such is privilege. The subjugation resulting from existence itself, regardless of any historical past, is enough to configure a revolutionary disposition.
</p>

<p>
Unlearned, irrelevant, entirely subjugated, but conscious of this fact. The unavoidable reality facing those unaccommodatable to the world. Pop music praises such things only to raise it to the level of commercial and romantic success. Success is always as lie. Failure is the appropriate structure for the current mode of production. An escalated, self-fulling failure fraught with “awesome” free wifi. Cybertorture in the form of provincialism. Torture because the provincial as such no longer exists, cyber because of its mode of distribution. If only we could accommodate our knowledge of death with our daily existence.
</p>

<p>
The come down: a realization that the only way forward is the way up. Just like being stuck at the bottom of the Grand  Canyon in the winter after dark, one first looks upward in disarray, then inward and finds enough to push towards survival. The way up… we’re lucky to no drown ourselves in so-called “debt” or worse, to drudge and toil in the sql mines of techstopia.

<p>
Garbage writing. Escaping the cliche in writing seems impossible. Every sentence typed finds its double in the television program, even if you’ve never watched television. The diagnosis is likely a lack of education. Education is available only to those who..? 
</p>

<p>
Post-west means post-meaning. Post-meaning means go to work. Work means sit at the computer. The computer is the means of production, the mode of production, the relations of production. Sit at the computer means work, pornography, which is work. Work which is pornographic, full frontal in its demands for complicity. I’ve always had a passion for working, at least in this ring of consciousness. Thus the hope for the greys. Turning into itself, belief turns into pornography. And why not? This is lived life, both in banal triviality and in essential objective spirit. Pop music never betrays itself, instead only forcing itself true, a conscious making true of its own prophecies. 
</p>

<p>
With every word one puts oneself further into the margins of thought. An unemployable, ungraduable downward movement of thought as it becomes self-conscious of its own self-alienation. Is it any surprise—as we know, sex is the promise to well-behaved bodies. At least we grow old, and only have to view such problems through an ever more cloudier lens. Life, folding into itself, expecting its own distortion. 
</p>

<p>
The paraphrase: “Life today sees its double, and seeks to eliminate it. It succeeds, only to find that it is itself that it has killed, and only the double remains.” The cult of bildung captures itself in its own colorful net…………………………….. amen.
Today, language can spill itself, spill over itself, without concern. Language is epiphenomenal to the accumulation that through and through dominates everyday life. We are all justified, therefore, in spilling onto the page any assemblage of words, sentences, propositions, senses, so long as we… go to work? This is the insight of pc music, which certainly works! 
</p>

<p>
I thought I had seen it all. But the picture-desire proves its truth via its capacity for total appropriation. Is the picture the mirror of production? 
</p>

<p>
Desire—its no coincidence that I have no knowledge of its inner workings. Is psychoanalysis the secret of a life which continuously unlives itself? Or perhaps something else, hopefully not attendance at a top graduate school. 
</p>

<p>
A sexy existence, on the one hand completely impossible today, on the other hand seemingly possible through the outer presentation of select people. We see them, people who perhaps have such an aesthetic, libidinal existence. But they always, in one way or another, expose themselves. We come to see the naked body at a distance, which we know from experience is indistinguishable from any other naked body. It is only in our symbolic dress where the large-scale differences between human beings become perceptible.

<h2 id="orgheadline8">On loneliness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
Recently questioned on how to avoid loneliness when digging yourself into a hole, i.e. the way I live my life. What follows is my saccharine response.
You don’t. It’s no secret that the whole monogamous partnership thing is primarily motivated out of a fear of being alone, despite our pretentious to the contrary regarding the beauty of love, etc. (although these shouldn’t be written of entirely, they are just not the fundamental ground for the behavior). For me, I’ve felt alone for so long that I’ve developed what I imagine are typical coping mechanisms: a thicker skin, a richer appreciation for and greater reliance on the true intimacies that I do have, a rejection of the bourgeoise demands to ‘stay safe and have fun’ and a recognition of the failure of society to live up to its grandiose promises (the short term solution to which is an open acceptance of the poverty of daily life). 
</p>

<p>
The dramas of music and cinema before the completion of today’s global capital give examples of what I mean. For example Greil Marcus uses the phrase “the old, weird america” to describe “the often eerie country, blues, and folk music feature on the Anthology of American Folk Music”. This type of drama emphasizes that death is waiting around the corner and turns towards more essential shapes of life (religion, family, catastrophe) in order to make sense and value in the world. Loneliness is given a full treatment and is openly discussed. I think you can find this in a lot of places, especially in something like the Torah. This is a stark contrast to the claims of the so-called interconnectedness that we are supposed to attribute to ourselves today. The economic reality around us one that secretly feeds on the isolation of individuals while proclaiming to bring absolute connectedness to the world (which is, of course, in some senses absolutely true). 
</p>

<p>
Loneliness is more or less essential to life (at least as we conceive it today) and to try and avoid it entirely is to miss the point, similar to pain. One can trade in some kinds of loneliness (e.g. always surround themselves with others) but this comes at well-known costs. So, at least for now, one must be lonely, But for me, this open admission of loneliness brings with it a liberation from the truly impressioning pretensions to the contrary (e.g. going to see avengers with friends your don’t even really like in order to not be alone) and encourages a fuller appreciation for the historic struggles of those similar to us, shining light on our own subjugation to an unknown system (and thus also the paths of escape). This doesn’t mean throw out your friends and your lovers; it means ruthlessly filter and then fully appreciate. Unfortunately I’m still stuck on the former. 
</p>

<p>
Another and final perspective: clearly I’ve come to see myself as a complete outsider, perhaps even a sort of terrorist, to popular society. I openly mock, experience extreme nausea from, and overall despise many behaviors often considered entirely ‘normal’ (e.g. facebook). By understanding myself as entirely Other, I “rationalize” my loneliness, I find it  easier and more acceptable that I’m often alone. The point of bringing this perspective up is not to praise it but to point out its problems. Such a perspective is ultimately at the whims of that which I despise. The conclusion to be drawn at the end is the same at the beginning: as far as I know, there are no solutions to loneliness as we currently experience it. But that doesn’t stop me from going to underground techno parties and dreaming of art history majors, or from finding  real comfort in my attempts to historically and theoretically understand loneliness as I suffer from its causes and symptoms.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
Behind us is a film on modernity versus tradition. Tradition is the assemblage of the shapes of life and concepts that determine the legitimate ways of judging for a group, the normatively of a community. Tradition is the arbitrary that develops itself beyond the arbitrary, erasing the incommensurable to pave way for the judicable, especially in cases in which praxis demands an answer. As we know, modernity is the edifice of the incommensurable, which ultimately replaces the task of “seeing things as they really are” with “how things seem to us”, or more accurately, the unity of the two perspectives, of the objective and the subjective, of the infinite and the finite, of being and essence. The work of modernity is the field in which the pinnacle of judgement arrises, finding only its lower developments on each side of history.

<p>
The loud noises of flat life can be accompanied well by a good mirroring: noise music, which reminds us of our own noises.
